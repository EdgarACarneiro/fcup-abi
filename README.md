## Projects

Notice that the reports were made in my native language, portuguese. Why? It was faster that way.

## Exam

While studying for the exam, a Summary was developed. Besides a summary of the lectured material, it also features several step-by-step explanations of Bioinformatics algorithms. You can check it [here](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/fcup-abi/blob/master/Summary.md).
