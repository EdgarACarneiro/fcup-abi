### BioSeq Read Me

All the commands are to be executed in the main folder:

To import the module you just have to right `from bioseq import BioSeq`, and then use the static method `BioSeq.create_bio_seq(seq, seq_type="dna")`. It will return an object and we can use its method to utilize the BioSeq library!

To run run_me.py: `python3 run_me.py`

To run all tests: `python3 -m unittest discover`
